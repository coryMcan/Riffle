# Riffle
/**
 * This program creates a standard card deck, shuffles it using random access on an int array, then shuffles again using the
 * "Riffle" method, where you divide the deck into two 'halves' which may be unequal in size and stack card by card from each half
 * until you have a shuffled deck.
 *
 * isSingleRiffled is a Riffle check that ensures all cards in the deck have been shuffled using the Riffle method.
